## Simple Timer Todo's

This file contains a list of things I want to add/improve (etc).
Note that this doesn't mean that the things in this list is going to be added, it's more of a "things I can do but might not" list. (Yes, that makes a lot of sense, I know)

- Create a OnTimerStart delegate that gets called when the timer starts. 
- Make the TimerManager independent on MonoBehaviour.
- Improve the comments/documentation.
- Improve the code. Make it **even** easier to use.
